# Code Examples And Challanges

This is a collection of different code examples I've created. Some were for fun others were for coding challanges.

- ## Creating an API using a json file as the data store
  
  I needed to create a basic crud for an upcoming project. The project is a simple app that will allow me to jot down Resturants that I would like to try. 

     - For now we will keep it basic, Just include the Name, Address, City, and website or social media links if available
     - The the only required field should be the Name.
